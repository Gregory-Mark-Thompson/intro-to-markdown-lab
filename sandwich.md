_Contrary to the popular belief of 1st graders, sandwiches are not actually witches that live in the desert. Interestingly, it is true that the Earl of Sandwich gave the sandwich its name in English (see [Sandwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich) wiki). In a similar vein, delis actually don't get their name from the Indian city of New Dehli (which actually contains Old Dehli within it, which is strange). For that matter, The Dalai Lama also has nothing to do with delis or Dehli, coincidentally, old or new (the city, that is-- the Dahli Lama is of course quite old-- everybody knows that), & neither does Salvador Dalí, while we aren't on the subject._

# 1. Gather the Perfect Bread

The first step in making the perfect sandwich is getting the perfect bread, or at least the most perfect bread you can find in a practical manner.
 + Bread from the supermarket can be fine if nothing else is available in your local area, but it's better if you get it from somewhere like Panera that specializes in baking.
 + A independent bakery or bread from a farmer's market is even better, as chains like Panera tend to use some amount of artificial preservatives to make sure their products can travel over vast distances. Local bakeries almost never do this because their goods are only intended for the local area, not some remote location hundreds of miles away.
 + If you are really ambitious, and have some amount of free time, you can learn to bake bread yourself.
    + That way, you can ensure that only the finest ingredients are used.
    + Additionally, baking your own bread can ensure that your sandwich has bread that is not stale even slightly.

# 2. Gather the Perfect Protein

The second step in making the perfect sandwich is getting the perfect protein, and this is perhaps the most important step in the whole process!
 + Again, the supermarket should be your the last resort if you truely strive for perfection in your persuit of the production of a heavely deli product.
 + Local butcher's shops are usually quite high quality, and farmer's markets also have excellent protein offerings.
 + If you live in a rural area, your neighbors might be kind enough to share anything they've hunted with you, and venison can be a premium option if available (fun fact-- Shakespeare was actually forced to flee his native Stratford because he loved the taste of deer meat so much, he kept hunting it illegally until the local lord banished him, forcing him to make his living writing some of the foundational phrases of the English language). You, of course, can hunt deer or other potential sandwich proteins yourself, such a wild boar (though that can be quite dangerous), provided it's legal in your local area of course.
 + Fish can also potentially go great in a sandwich, and it's a bit easier to go fishing than to go hunting if you want to do it yourself, but of course those have to be deboned carefully, and cooking fish for a sandwich is a bit less straightforward than preparing game or poultry for it. Nonetheless, it's an option that shouldn't be overlooked-- I love a good fish sandwich from time to time.
> Some people think that you can make a _Vegi Sandwich_ or a _Vegi Burger_. While it is true that you _can_ make one, perhaps there should be a law making it illegal, because such food items are not satisfactory in the slightest, and only someone wallowing in the deepest depths of a cult-like self-imposed gas-lighting would stoop to calling such abominations of the culinary arts "perfect." Falafel is great though, and a falafel sandwich _can_ attain a level of perfection like any other sandwich, unlike the unfortunate "vegi sandwich."

# 3. Gather the Perfect Vegetables & Condiments

The third step in making the perfect sandwich is getting the perfect vegetables & condiments for your choice of meat.
 + I say vegetables & condiments, because you really need **both** _vegetables_ **and** _condiments_.
 + For lighter meats such as chicken and turkey, Dijon mustard is a solid choice for a condiment. For darker meats such as venison or even bison or moose, a fruity sauce like plum sauce pairs quite well. For fish, squeezed lemon is usually all you need, but if you have a private chef, perhaps he could make some kind of cream sauce that would beautifully accent it and bring out its subtle flavors.
 + Ketchup should be avoided if at all possible-- it's a perfectly fine condiment for eating meatloaf in the 1950s, or a hamburger at a low-priced burger-shack on the side of the highway, but for the _"Perfect"_ sandwich, we must elevate our standards and our imaginations if we are to achieve the heights of human potential.
 + Lettuce is a must in almost any kind of sandwich, or a lettuce substitute like spinach leaves, but not that aweful iceberg shredded stuff you see in Subway-- lettuce from a farmer's market or on the side of the road sold by a literal farmer or, if worst comes to worst, in those terrible and overpriced plastic containers in the grocery store.
 + Pickles, preferably kosher, are a solid choice in red meat sandwiches, as are sliced tomatoes, and both of these can potentially work well with fish even, but they don't mix well with mustard, so if that's your condiment, I'd avoid them. Some people think cucumbers belong in sandwiches. Those people are wrong-- pickels only; no cucumbers.

 > Cheese _can_ be a part of an ideal sandwich, but it's usually a dangerous gamble-- the flavor of cheese is strong, so it can easily overwhelm and bury the more delicate notes in the culinary scale that is your sandwich-- use it with caution and experiment extensively before presenting the dish to unwitting outsiders or loved ones.

# 4. Construct your Sandwich and then Consume it

The fourth & final step in making the perfect sandwich is to put it together and eat it.
 + I say this as one step even though it's technically two because inevitably, you will eat the sandwich in about a minute upon putting it together, because you won't be able to control yourself to slow down because it will be so heavenly delicious.
 + Here are the basic steps in sandwich assemblage:
    1. Slice the bread.
        - It should be thin, but not so thin that it will break apart-- achieving that elusive medium where it's just thin enough to do the job of holding your precious foodstuff together but not dangerously thin is truly one of the definitive marks of a master chef.
        - If it's sliced too thick, the bread's taste and texture will drown out the main flavors, those of the protein and condiments. Also, it will be hard for you to open your jaws enough to eat your so desperately quested-after grail of a meal.
    2. Put the protein and vegetables in between the two slices of bread.
    3. Use the gap between the protein and the lettuce or lettuce-substitute to house the condiments.
        - That way, any sauces won't soak into the bread, damaging its structural integrity and generally making it feel slimy and disgusting.
        - The neutral taste of the greens is a great way to highlight the strong taste characteristics of the condiments and protein on the one hand, and the earthy, savory flavor notes of the bread on the other.
    4. Eat your fully realized and glorious invention!
        - Try not to eat it too fast, though I realize that will be hard. Because if you try to eat it too quickly, you might start choking on it, and that could potentially lead to death if no one is around who knows the Heimlich Maneuver.
        - Moreover, if you are a little disciplined, eating your handiwork slower than your instincts would naturally allow for, you will appreciate it more and achieve greater heights of sensual pleasure in eating it. Bon Appétit!
